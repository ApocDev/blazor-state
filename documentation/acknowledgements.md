## Acknowledgements
Jimmy Bogard (MediatR). Jimmy is an amazing developer and a knowledge sharer.  
Through his course at https://11xengineering.com/ , 
his many blog posts on Los Techies and now https://jimmybogard.com/. 
I have learned great amounts.

Peter Morris ([Blazor-Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/blazor-fluxor)). Pete and I 
have been friends for many years and he is an amazing developer and person who has taught me much.
Not surprisingly Pete and I think much alike. 
We independently started working on our Redux replacement
components. Although I started first :P (By like a few days)
Pete's component attempts to solve most of the same problems.
Blazor-State draws on the strengths of a proven pipeline in MediatR where as Fluxor 
implements its own middle-ware.  
If Blazor-State does not meet your needs be sure to checkout Fluxor.

Tor Hovland ([Blazor-Redux](https://github.com/torhovland/blazor-redux)).
I have only know Tor for a short time via the gitter on Blazor but he is already stimulating ideas.
If you use F# and need redux like functionality checkout his library.
