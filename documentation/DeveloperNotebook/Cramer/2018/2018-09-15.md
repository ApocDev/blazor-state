I have response to my gitHub Post

https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/7669#issuecomment-421443092

Seems I have a build issue.

Looking into this.  As worked before.

Seems to be based on sdk version:

It seems to work for dotnet 2.1.401
```
C:\git\temp
位  dotnet --version
2.1.401
C:\git\temp
位  dotnet new -u
Template Instantiation Commands for .NET Core CLI

Currently installed items:
 Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ItemTemplates
 Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ProjectTemplates.2.1
 Microsoft.DotNet.Test.ProjectTemplates.2.1
 Microsoft.DotNet.Web.ItemTemplates
 Microsoft.DotNet.Web.ProjectTemplates.2.1
 Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates
 NUnit3.DotNetNew.Template
 TimeWarp.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates
C:\git\temp
```
But switching to 2.1.402 and it goes away.
```
C:\git\temp
位  dotnet --version
2.1.402
C:\git\temp
位  dotnet new -u
Template Instantiation Commands for .NET Core CLI

Currently installed items:
 Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ItemTemplates
 Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ProjectTemplates.2.1
 Microsoft.DotNet.Test.ProjectTemplates.2.1
 Microsoft.DotNet.Web.ItemTemplates
 Microsoft.DotNet.Web.ProjectTemplates.2.1
 Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates
 NUnit3.DotNetNew.Template
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates
C:\git\temp
```
So I am going to make sure everything references 2.1.402 and try again.

It seems my CI build was not copying the .template.config

Upon further review I don't think I need as complicated a build as Blazor does so I eliminated some of these settings and just manually update the .template.config.

This eliminates the added MSBuild/csproj file that was not being properly executed to copy from .template.config.src.

I don't think I need C:\git\github\blazor-state\build\dependencies.props file either.

Although source\TimeWarp.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates\content\Directory.Build.props file 
is designed to <!-- Intentionally does not import parent Directory.Build.props file to isolate templates projects from the rest of the repo -->

But I don't need to import so change to just <Project/>

So now the nuget pack should get the templates.
