Going to write End to end test for all the pages now that I have one to go from.

Slow day so far.  Mostly cleanup. FetchData Test

WaitAndAssert cleanup.

## Test Fixtures.
Test Fixture: A known starting state(baseline) for all tests.
And the collection of common set of functions.

### Things in our TestFixtures
  * ServiceProvider
  * Mediator
  * DbContext
  * Blazor-State Store.
  * Respawn checkpoint.

Typically we will have a ServiceProvider in the TestFixture/
For MediatR base items we will have `SendAsync` methods.
For DbContext we would want ability to configure the DB with specific Data
Respawn so we can reset the database.
Blazor State we want to be able to initialize to a know state on the client.

I could make these all fixtures or interfaces?  For now goign to be one TestFixture. After complete and function I can consider refactoring.

BlazorState.Server for example the test fixture
