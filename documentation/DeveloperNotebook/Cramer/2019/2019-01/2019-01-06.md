- [x] Get powershell script to publish documentation to work.
- [x] File PR to fix it https://github.com/JamesRandall/Vsts-GitHub-Pages-Publish/pull/5
- [ ] Create new Command to generate Toc.yml files based on markdown files in the directory.

I will add a header to these files similar to the following:  With something we can regex for on first line.
```
# auto-generated
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    This code was generated from a template.
#
#    Manual changes to this file may cause unexpected behavior in your application.
#     Manual changes to this file will be overwritten if the code is regenerated.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If the file is auto-generated we are free to delete and regenerate.  If it doesn't have this header we will consider it a manually generate toc and won't deleted it.

Requirements: I want to be able to run the command from anywhere inside the git repo and have it find the docfx.json folder and generate for all below it excluding:
* api
* _site
* images
* Or if no children have any .md files

Acceptance critera:

We should have a test case.
