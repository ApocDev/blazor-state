Change the Azure DevOps Agent to run as my user so it can access the global installed selenium standalone.

I can't figure out how to use MyGet with templates. 
I filed this issue https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/7669

Update docfx to 2.39.2.0

Add some beginning documentation on the templates.

Update the production yaml.
