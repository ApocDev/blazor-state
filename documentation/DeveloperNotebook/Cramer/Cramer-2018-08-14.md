I opted to do Herc-PWA testing project first.

Primary task now is to update to 0.5.0 with confidence.
Thus I need test cases here. 

curious how to test Blazor from the UI.

AngleSharp is used in Blazor and I would think I could use it?  Looking for examples.

Although Blazor does its UI testing with Selenium.

I would prefer to avoid Selenium.

## Try and get blazor building local along with tests.

Starting with the docs here
https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor

The build completed successfully but

```
build.cmd /t:Test
```
failed

because selenium is NOT installed.

It requires JAVA Yuck!  Which the directions to install Java even stink.

### Spent last hour plus trying to get Blazor itself to build.

It now works from the command line but still not in Visual Studio.

Goal is to try and see how the selenium tests were written. And see if I can do it in Blazor-State and Herc-PWA

I am learning the xunit stuff as well as the interesting way Blazor does the tests. 

I am using DI for testcases in Fixie and have 
a BrowserFixture working.

Tomorrow work on the ServerFixture.
