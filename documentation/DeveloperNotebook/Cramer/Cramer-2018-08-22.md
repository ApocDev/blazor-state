2018-08-22 11:50:06 Reviewing the new features and the code in Blazor-State.

First thought I see is in App.cshtml. I split out the CS to code behind
App.cshtml.cs with class AppModel.

Now Why do I need Singletons as components?  Why not just create them up front?
Startup creates the first thing.

aBlazorApplicationBuilder.AddComponent<App>("app");

So se could either use services 

```csharp
aBlazorApplicationBuilder.Services.GetService<RouteManager>();
```
or we can inject things into the App.

Previous version used the OnInit

```csharp
  builder.OpenComponent<JavaScriptInteropComponent>(0);
  builder.CloseComponent();
  builder.OpenComponent<ReduxDevToolsComponent>(0);
  builder.CloseComponent();
  builder.OpenComponent<RouteManagerComponent>(1);
  builder.CloseComponent();
```

but thats ugly and maybe can be cleaner now.

trying it out now with injecting into the App.

First test remove RouteManagerComponent

And inject the RouteManager directly in the `AppModel`

```csharp
[Inject] private RouteManager RouteManager { get; set; }
```

it works.

Need to run End-to-end tests  Start selenium with the following.

```
selenium-standalone start
```
* Cleaned up all the code.
* Refactored App
* moved all @functions to code behind

tomorrow add blazorstate.server.integration.tests and fix Javascript interop
