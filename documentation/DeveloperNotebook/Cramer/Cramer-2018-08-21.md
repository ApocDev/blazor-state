2018-08-21 12:17:29  Testing using TestServer is now working.

We now have 4 testing levels.

Unit tests.  Just a class.
Integration tests that exercise Features. 
Integration tests that exercise Features that actually include TestServer
End-to-End testing using UI and Selenium.

Unit being fastest and End-to-end being the slowest.

A TestFixture can provide functions for 

ServiceCollection ( client and server)
Mediator: clien and Server (if needed)
Respawn: server
DbContext: server
BlazorState: client


In 0.5.1 we have Startup and service provide and builder concept for the client.
I should be able to use the Startup class on the client

2018-08-21 13:26:33  Tests are passing Startup and Program working

TestServer should now use Startup.  I am going to clean that up.
