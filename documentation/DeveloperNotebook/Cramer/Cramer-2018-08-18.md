# Immutable State where only Handlers can mutate state.

I want the State to have Private setters so the developer can NOT accidentally mutate state.  
Yet I want the Handler classes to actually be able to mutate the state.
I remembered that C++ had something like this with friend classes.  
It was while searching for `c# friend class` when I found the below link.

The solution is to have the handlers as child classes of the State.
This very similar to how I did all the Features in my JimmyMVC blog post years ago.
a child class has access to the parent private properties.

Given that Handlers by design are only to act on a specific  `State` this was simple to do.
I change the State to be a partial class.
Then change the Handler to a child class of State.

- [ ] Refactoring Sample app to immutable state.

Tests although would be nice to way to set a known state.
But we don't want the dev to cheat and use this method to mutate state.
We add comment that says for Test only and also added this.  Maybe I should make a ThrowIfNotTest?


```csharp
if (!Assembly.GetCallingAssembly().FullName.Contains("Test"))
{
  throw new System.FieldAccessException("Do not use this in production. This method is intended for Test access only!");
}
```

- [x] ThrowIfNotTestAssembly


```csharp
    public void ThrowIfNotTestAssembly(Assembly aAssembly)
    {
      if (!aAssembly.FullName.Contains("Test"))
      {
        throw new System.FieldAccessException("Do not use this in production. This method is intended for Test access only!");
      }
    }
```
