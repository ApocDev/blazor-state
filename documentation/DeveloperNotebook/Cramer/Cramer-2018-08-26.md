 2018-08-26 09:34:37 Just added the Integration testing for the server.

 Only a Single Feature so the `TestFixutre` is simplified since no `DbContext`.
 Maybe we do ContosoUniversity at some point as Sample and look at Flight Finder demo for 
 anything interacting

 All tests passing Stack was able to build on his machine.
