- [ ] Update Samples to latest templates

Updating the project and having confidence that I didn't break anything would be great.
How to do that, is to add tests.  This actually takes some planning and time.
Reviewing Jimmy Bogard ContosoUniv to see if I can get ideas.  I also prefer to use fixie now.

Going to start with integration tests.  As frankly I think they provide more value than Unit tests.
Yes they are slower.

I could add Integration test to the Sample app.  This duals as tests for the component as well.

Going to start 2 new projects Unit Tests for BlazorState itself and integration tests for the Hosted project
