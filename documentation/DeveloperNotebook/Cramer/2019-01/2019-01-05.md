Updated Selenium to latest 

```
npm install selenium-standalone@latest -g
selenium-standalone install
```

testing the yaml changes from yesterday

- [x] Split yml into a yml file per output.
        Add yml for production versions of blazor-state and templates.
- [ ] Determine the dependencies of the build.
- [x] Move the yml files to the Build folder.  They seem to make more sense by themselves.
