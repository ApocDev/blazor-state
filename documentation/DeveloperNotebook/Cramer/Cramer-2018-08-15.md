Today task is Server Fixture for Selenium.
This will fire up the Server that we intend to test.

Referencing the Blazor project itself for ideas on how to do this.

Only needed for E2E testing.

Features I think will be more easily and faster tested via integration testing at MediatR level.  But we want capabilities to test at all levels Unit->E2E

I got a passing test using Selenium.  Still uses XUnit
although I would prefer fixie.

Now trying to duplicate with fixie an eliminate Xunit.

Still going looking promising
This will give is reference architecture for Unit, Integration and End-to-end testing.

2018-08-15 18:07:10 - It works finally.

Next I need to determine what needs to be tested at each level.
Unit tess would be only if something complicated in a single class.  "Don't mock your friends"

Integration Tests for all the Features both server and client.

End-to-End tests for all the pages and routes at least.
With some basic interactions.
