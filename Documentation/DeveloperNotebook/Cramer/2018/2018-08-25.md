Finally it seems I have time travel working with ReduxDevTools.

Hyrdrate methods are required to overcome the private setters.

So test cases I can debug.  
I created a test case for the Store ShouldLoadStatesFromJson
and this is a ton easier than trying to debug via browser and Console.writeline.
why didn't I think of that earlier no idea.

Finally I have the Hydrate stuff working. It isn't too terrible.
Only required if one wants to use devtools and I wrap them in
conditional compilation blocks.  
As Redux dev tools shouldn't be used in production.

State seems to get clutterd with functionality.
Clone Initialize etc...
I wonder if we should have State as a DTO and then 
StateManager or something for the functionality??  Maybe later.
