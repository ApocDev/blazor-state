## Release 2.0.0

Since have moved from preview builds to release, and ReduxDevTools should be disabled in production, we are changing the default option setting to be disabled.

`BlazorStateOptions.UseReduxDevToolsBehavior` now defaults to false; 

See [Migrations](xref:BlazorState:Migration1-2.md) for how to migrate existing projects from 1.0 to 2.0.
